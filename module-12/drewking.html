                        In 2015 I hiked the Camino de Santiago, a 500 mile journey across Northern Spain. Since doing so I have hiked in over 8 states and plan to hike the "Triple Crown" in the next 5 years. Hiking is more than hobby it is the passion that fuels my life.

                        Since childhood Drew loved the idea of traveling to far off lands and having wild adventures. Reading fueled this passion and she has seen the Eiffel Tower and the cathedrals of Spain to the Grand Canyon and Zion National Park. Drew has traveled to twenty-two states along with three countries in Europe. Traveling is not only a source of inspiration but also a way to step outside of one's comfort zone and truly having experiences.

                        After seeing over one hundred concerts and traveling all over the country to see various performers it is more than a hobby but a true love. All forms of music are equally respected as they all have their place and can be found enjoyable given the right environment. True favorites are Bob Dylan, Kendrick Lamar, Travis Scott, Brad Paisley, and Brandi Carlile.
